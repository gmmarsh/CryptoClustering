# CryptoClustering
This is a Python and unsupervised learning analysis to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

The following process was followed:

The data was prepared for analysis using the standard scaler from scikit learn.

The best value for k was found in order to utilize the k-means algorithm for clustering.

The crypto currencies were then clustered and plotted using hvplots.

Next, the clusters were opitimized using principal component analysis.

Again, the best value for k was determined.

The crypto currencies were clustered using K-means using the principal component data.

Finally, a comparison between the first k-means cluster and the second principal component cluster analyses was made.

A conclusion as to the best method was stated.
